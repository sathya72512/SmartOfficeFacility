# Smart Office Facility Management System

## üìå Overview

This project is a **Smart Office Facility Management System** implemented in Java.
It demonstrates the use of **design patterns** such as **Singleton**, **Observer**, and **Command**, along with an **auto-release feature** for meeting rooms.

The system allows users to interact through a console with commands to book rooms, cancel bookings, add/remove occupants, and exit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

* **Singleton**:
  `OfficeManager` ensures only one instance manages all rooms.

* **Observer**:
  When occupants enter or leave, `Room` notifies `ACController` and `LightController` to switch ON/OFF automatically.

* **Command Pattern**:
  User actions (`book`, `cancel`, `add`, `remove`) are implemented as separate command classes (`BookRoomCommand`, `CancelRoomCommand`, etc.).

* **Auto Release**:
  If a room is booked but remains empty for 10 seconds (demo; in real system 5 minutes), it is automatically released.

* **Exception Handling**:
  Invalid room IDs throw a custom exception (`InvalidRoomException`).

* **Interactive Console**:
  User can type commands like:

  ```
  book <roomId>
  cancel <roomId>
  add <roomId> <count>
  remove <roomId>
  exit
  ```
